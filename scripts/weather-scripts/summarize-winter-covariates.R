# Note: by setting symmetrical = TRUE it includes the distance between a 
# pair only once in the data frame (ie, distance between A and B is included, but 
# not distance between B and A) 

# Add site names to distance data frame for convenience
dists$from_name <- winter$code[match(dists$from, winter$site_num)]

# Why the distinct() function didn't catch these duplicated coordinates in the 
# script I used to download the data from GBIF? Because they are indeed different.
# I didn't notice the difference in the coordinates, because my RStudio was not 
# set up to show all decimals in the output or in the data frames, so I was seeing 
# just the first three decimals of the coordinates, therefore they apparently 
# were duplicates when they were not. I set up the decimals in R 
# studio to 15 digits by running: options(digits = 15)

# Now I can see all the decimals in the coordinates and know why distinct() kept 
# all these 'duplicated' sites.

# one of the paired points that are less than 1000 m apart. But this approach won't 
# work as I realize have clusters of points that are close together, not just 
# pairs of points.So I tried the next approach.

# 2) Thinning points based on clusters of points. I used ChatGPT to build this 
# code

# We need to use the points as an sf object, transform SpatVectors to sf objects 
sf.points <- sf::st_as_sf(locs.new)

# Transform coordinates from degrees to UTM
locs.UTM <- st_transform(sf.points,
                         crs = 32614) # UTM zone 14N for central Mexico

# Extract coordinates from the sf object and transform the points into a numeric 
# matrix to use dbscan package to find clusters based on a 1000 m distance 
# threshold
coords <- st_coordinates(locs.UTM)
# There are 133 coordinates representing the 133 points in winter.new. Good

# Perform clustering
# dbscan: Density-based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise
# epsilon neighborhood: set of points that lie within a specified distance
clusters <- dbscan(coords, # A data matrix 
                   eps = 1000, # Radius of the epsilon neighborhood
                   minPts = 1) # Number of minimum points required in the eps neighborhood

# Group the points by their cluster ID and keep one point from each cluster

# Add cluster IDs to the sf object
locs.UTM$cluster <- clusters$cluster

# Retain one point per cluster (the first one encountered)
unique.points.sf <- locs.UTM[!duplicated(locs.UTM$cluster), ]

# Output summary
print(paste("Original number of points:", nrow(locs.UTM)))
print(paste("Number of unique points after clustering:", nrow(unique.points.sf)))
# This code reduces the winter sites to 112

# Plot new points
ggplot() +

        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 7),

        plot.subtitle = element_text(color = "black", size = 12, hjust = 0.5)) 

# Create list of final points to use to summarize the weather data
points.final <- unique.points.sf %>% 
  as.data.frame() %>% 
  select(code)
length(unique(points.final$code))  

# I'm still not sure this is the best approach to thin the points, because 
# considering that the diagonal in 1 km2 is a bit over 1400 meters, potentially 
# I could still have two points in the same daymet grid cell even if they are 
# 1000 meters apart (cluster threshold). So, I could increase the threshold 
# > 1400 meters, or try the next approach.

# 3) Using a grid to thin the points

# Using the spatial resolution of the daymet data, I thought to add a 
# grid over the map and ask R to thin the points based on where on the map the 
# points fall. Again, I used ChatGPT to build this code after I couldn't use the
# code I gathered by using Google searchs (lines xxx to xxx)

# First, I need to use an sf object
sf.points.for.grid <- sf::st_as_sf(locs.UTM)

# Create a Daymet grid

# Create a bbox object to define the extent of the points
# bbox = bounding box 
bbox <- st_bbox(sf.points.for.grid) 

# Create a 1 km x 1 km grid over the extent of the points
grid <- st_make_grid(
  st_as_sfc(bbox, crs = st_crs(sf.points.for.grid)), # Use the bounding box of the points
  cellsize = 1000, # Daymet grid resolution in meters
  square = TRUE) # If FALSE, creates an hexagonal grid

# Convert the grid to an sf object
sf.grid <- st_sf(geometry = grid)

# Adjust the points to the grid
# Find the grid cell each point falls into
sf.points.for.grid$grid_id <- st_within(sf.points.for.grid, sf.grid) %>% as.integer()
sf.points.for.grid <- sf.points.for.grid %>% 
  arrange(cluster)

head(sf.points.for.grid, 10)
# It is interesting how some points that where in the same cluster now are not
# in the same cell grid (ws1 and ws201) and how points that were in the same cluster
# are also in the same grid (ws5 and 145). Still wondering which way is the best
# way to thinned the points. I would like to hear your thoughts :) 

# If points fall outside the grid, they won't have a match. These will have NA 
# as their grid_id. Check if there are any NA values
which(is.na(sf.points.for.grid$grid_id))

# Points might fall outside the grid if:
# 1) There is a bounding box misalignment, because the grid is created with a 
# fixed cell size (1km x 1km). If the bounding box dimensions are not divisible 
# evenly by the cell size, the grid might not fully cover the bounding box's 
# exact boundaries. Bbox is created based on the points.
# 2) Minor floating-point errors can sometimes cause coordinates to fall just 
# outside the intended grid due to precision issues.
# 3) Small discrepancies can arise from the transformation process (coordinates, 
# crs).
# 4) Points that lie exactly on the edges of the bounding box might not fall into 
# any grid cell.

# There are some ways to add this points to the grid, but before doing that I'm
# going to explore the points with NA values

# First, make sure the crs in the grid and the points is the same
st_crs(sf.points.for.grid) == st_crs(sf.grid)
# They are the same

# Filter NA values
na.values.grid <- sf.points.for.grid %>% 
  filter(is.na(grid_id))

# Plot points with NA values
sf.na.values <- sf::st_as_sf(na.values.grid)
ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = sf.points.for.grid, color = 'blue', size = 0.5) +
  geom_sf(data = na.values.grid, color = 'red', size = 0.1) +
  geom_sf_text(data = na.values.grid, 
               aes(label = code), 
               nudge_y = 40000, 
               nudge_x = 40000,
               size = 3)

# Before deciding if these points need to be added to the grid, I'm running the 
# next step in the thinning process to keep only one point per grid cell
thinned.points <- sf.points.for.grid %>%
  group_by(grid_id) %>%
  slice(1) %>%
  ungroup()

# Check if the two points with NA values in grid_id are in the thinned.points
# data set. After looking at the map, my guess is that the point ws36 won't be
# in the data set because it is really close to other points, so if this point
# is not included in the final 'thinned.points' it is fine. On the other hand, 
# ws20 will be in the data set because there are no other points near it
c('ws36', 'ws20') %in% thinned.points$code

# This is true. It is fine if ws36 is not in the new data set, because this point 
# is already being represented by another near by point. Now, ws20 it is included 
# but I think we should leave it outside the analysis because it is near Guatemala
# where there is a resident population of BTLH. We can discuss more about this.
# For now I'm going to leave ws20 out.

# 4) Defining cold days

# Some papers I read about winter conditions affecting survival of other
# bird species used a measure of 'extreme weather event (ewe).' In some cases, these
# events were the number of days certain variable was too low (e.g temperature). 
# To define the threshold for the ewe, researchers used the 10th percentile of 
# the variable they were measuring, which can highlight rare or extreme conditions 
# experienced by the birds. 

# We discussed using the number of days the temperature was too cold in our
# winter grounds, so I'm going to count the number of days the temperature was equal 
# or under a 'threshold.' I need to read more about this threshold in BTLH or 
# other hummingbird species.For now I'm going to use the 10th percentile of the min
# temperature as the threshold and see what I get.

# The question here is, what data should I use to calculate the 10th percentile?

# trying everything...
